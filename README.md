> ## ⚠️ Inventory Tweaks is no longer maintained

Please [explore alternatives for Minecraft versions 1.13 and above!](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/search?search=inventory%20tweaks)

There are currently no plans to upgrade Inventory Tweaks to Minecraft 1.13+. Due to major changes in the game code and in Forge's API, supporting the newest versions of the game would require a major mod rewrite, which the current maintainers do not have the time for. There are now viable alternatives out there, so we have archived this repository, but if you have the skill and time to tackle the mod upgrade, feel free to contact us.

## What's this project about

This Open Source project (see [License](https://github.com/Inventory-Tweaks/inventory-tweaks/blob/develop/LICENSE.md)) is a client mod for [Minecraft](http://www.minecraft.net/), a game by [Mojang AB](http://mojang.com/). It implements various features to help players with the management of inventories and chests. A lot of effort has been put to make it customizable and support most popular mods, without being annoying to set up.

For documentation about how to use or install the mod, see the [main page of Inventory Tweaks](http://inventory-tweaks.readthedocs.org/en/latest). This place is for developers!

## Developer setup

The mod is built using [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/) and [ForgeGradle](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/ForgeGradle).

To start coding, all is explained on the [project's wiki](https://github.com/Kobata/inventory-tweaks/wiki).
